# Emerge Test Fergus Hewson

Here is my submission for the emerge interview test.

This app was built using current modern android architecture patterns.

- Compose / M3
- Koin for DI
- OkHttp / retrofit for comms
- Moshi for serialization 

# Completed features
- Login
- Fake logout, note the delete session was not implemented
- Showing popular feed with adding to favorites (I could have implemented a tick to show the item was favorited on the popular tab)
- Showing favorite items with ability to remove
- Some caching of data was implemented, popular

# Limitations
- Storing of session on device was not implemented
- UI is very basic but usable, I ran out of time due to figuring out session handling for this API
